# Data-Structure-Project-Mini-Surf-system
A data structure project created by me and a partner, this project shows classes about surfers and their elements, all together in a mini system to show basic and advanced information about the attributes. 

To apply the project on your PC, download all the files in a folder and open on your code editor (VSS, PyCharm..)
